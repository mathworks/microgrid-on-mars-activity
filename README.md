## Files
### Challenge Files
This folder contains the instructions, templates, and examples for the challenge. All MATLAB and Simulink files are in here. 
1. Impedance Match: This folder includes example materials for Impedance Matching and Maximum Power Point Tracking.  
    - impedance_match.mlx contains instructions and an explanation of this concept 
    - impedance_match.slx is the Simulink model you can use to follow along with the example outlined in ‘impedance_match.mlx’ 
2. Resources: This folder contains resources for the MATLAB project, do not modify this. 
3. microgrid_on_mars.mlx: A MATLAB Live Script with instructions on how to complete the challenge. Start here! 
4. Microgrid_on_mars.prj: A MATLAB Project that will set up the environment for you. Double-click on this before you begin making changes or running any files.  
5. profileData.mat: A MATLAB data file that contains variables that will be used in the Simulink models for various tasks. These are automatically loaded when you open the MATLAB Project. 
6. Simulink files that start with 'Task': The simulink files you should use to create your solutions for each task.
